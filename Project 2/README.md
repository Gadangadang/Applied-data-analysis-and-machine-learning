This can be done by typing the following line into the terminal from the appropriate folder:
```
pip install -r requirements
```

This project aimes to look at how Neural Networks handle different challanges, from regression to classification. 
We look first at Stochastic gradient descent compared to OLS and Ridge, and then implement that method into
the Neural Network and compare it to OLS and Ridge aswell. Then we will try to permorme classification on breast cancer 
and digit data from Sciki-Learn, and test its accuracy against logistic regression and Scikit-learn. 

The project folder is structured in the following way: <br />
The "article" folder contains figures and the project raport. <br />

The "code" folder contains several subfolders: <br />
"data" contains the raw mnist data from scikit-learn. <br />
"Analysis and grid search" contains all <br />
